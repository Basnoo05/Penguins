# Penguins
Introduction
Predicting penguin species - modelling with binary classification

The data for this activity comes from a study of three different species of Antartic penguin: Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo.

In this notebook you will explore which features can be used to predict the species of a penguin.

You will build a model to predict whether a particular penguin is a Gentoo penguin, or not. So this is an example of binary classification.
